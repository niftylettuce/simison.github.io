<span class="lead">I have big plans for the winter! We'll rent a flat from Turkey and rewrite some code running Hitchwiki — The Hitchhiker's Guide to Hitchhiking the World.</span>

Me and [Rémi](https://github.com/Remigr) have been planning for a while to do big rewrite of [Hitchwiki.org](http://hitchwiki.org)'s wiki and maps. Wiki is good old MediaWiki (which we want to keep) and Maps is custom PHP code-jungle written by me one summer years ago.

It's finally time to rewrite it from the scratch and make something like this:

This is quite early preview and it's missing many things such as ratings, but it gives the basic idea what we want to achieve.

### Donation campaing

We're doing the rewrite this December 2014—January 2015 in Turkey. We will rent a house together for living and working.

To cover some costs **we're asking some [donations from the community](https://love.hitchwiki.net)**. Check it out and spread the word!
