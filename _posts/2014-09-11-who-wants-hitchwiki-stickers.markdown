<p class="lead">Hey! Do you want some awesome stickers with a thumb to decorate your computer, bike or a pole at the hitching spot? Drop me a message and I'll send you some.</p>

These are very nicey square 7x7cm stickers. They're not superduper quality nor long term weather resistant (I printed them very cheapy) but they're just fine.

And this is how they look. Pretty cool eh?

Drop me a message at <a href="mailto:mikael@ihminen.org">mikael@ihminen.org</a> or [elsewhere](/) and tell me your postal address. Depending a bit on demand I'll send you a few stickers, lemme know if you have loooads of friends with whom to share these and I'll send a bit more.

Those willing to print these by themself, just [grab the file](http://hitchwiki.org/en/File:Hw-sticker-7x7cm%2B2mm-bleed.jpg) from Hitchwiki.

If you feel like sharing some expenses, you can always [drop me a few coins](/volunteering/).
