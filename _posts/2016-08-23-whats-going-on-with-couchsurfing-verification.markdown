<span class="lead">
So this is how CouchSurfing currently operates: tell new members they can get added benefits by verifying themselves. Checking for their identity using credit card is easy. Forget to mention it actually costs. Just grab their money every year from that on.
</span>

That's pretty much what's been going on for the past few months. [CouchSurfing.com](https://www.couchsurfing.com) is really making an effort hiding away all the mentions about verification not being free.

The price is actually mentioned, but it's hidden until you click little shopping cart icon which brings a dropdown with the price written in small grey text (via <a href="https://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a>) or if you pay via <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe's</a> credit card popup, the price is visible in small grey text only when entering the card information.

Twitter is full of people complaining, here are just some:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Couchsurfing">@Couchsurfing</a> Question: why the fuck am I getting charged $60 to verify my account when this charge was never disclosed anywhere?</p>&mdash; Ed Geen Jetman (@GeneGetman) <a href="https://twitter.com/GeneGetman/status/898307334870532096">August 17, 2017</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Couchsurfing">@Couchsurfing</a> I accidentally verified without realizing there was a $50 fee. I do not want to verify. It was unclear, I want a refund.</p>&mdash; BEDPICNIC // geoff (@bedpicnic) <a href="https://twitter.com/bedpicnic/status/897946851546079232">August 16, 2017</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">you just took $70 from my paypal without stating how much it would cost to get verified? <a href="https://twitter.com/Couchsurfing">@Couchsurfing</a></p>&mdash; Skepta (@skeptacool) <a href="https://twitter.com/skeptacool/status/872421233316343808">June 7, 2017</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Verification process is very misleading for <a href="https://twitter.com/Couchsurfing">@Couchsurfing</a>!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Couchsurfing">@Couchsurfing</a> I was just billed a $70 verification fee. There is absolutely no mention of this anywhere until I got the PayPal Reciept 1/2</p>&mdash; Shawn Weber (@shawntweber) <a href="https://twitter.com/shawntweber/status/880276396861300737">June 29, 2017</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Couchsurfing">@Couchsurfing</a> is a scam. Verification in app is designed to trick people to give. It prompts to enter credit card to verify and they charge.</p>&mdash; jd (@radeeyjd) <a href="https://twitter.com/radeeyjd/status/850023826431787008">April 6, 2017</a></blockquote>

For refunds, <a href="https://support.couchsurfing.org/hc/en-us/articles/214633027-Verification-Payment-Questions">you can fill a form</a> but <a href="https://twitter.com/Marionfyrd/status/899341152754839557">it will take a while</a> before they'll get back to you.
