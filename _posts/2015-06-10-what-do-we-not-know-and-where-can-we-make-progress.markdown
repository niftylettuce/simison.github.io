<span class="lead">Physicist David Kaplan gives an excellent speech about why we shouldn't always be measuring the economic gain.</span>

A documentary "[Particle Fever](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1385956/)" about the [Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider) — the largest and most complex machine ever built — is a very thoughtful and entertaining film. This was my favorite bit from it (or check it [from the video](http://sploid.gizmodo.com/heres-the-perfect-answer-to-why-we-must-invest-in-pure-1665820877)):

<blockquote><em>The question by an economist was, "What is the financial gain of running an experiment like this and the discoveries that we will make in this experiment?" And it's a very, very simple answer.
<br><br>
I have no idea.
<br><br>
We have no idea.
<br><br>
When radio waves were discovered, they weren't called radio waves, because there were no radios. They were discovered as some sort of radiation.
<br><br>
Basic science for big breakthroughs needs to occur at a level where you're not asking, "What is the economic gain?" You're asking, "What do we not know, and where can we make progress?"
<br><br>
So what is the LHC good for? Could be nothing other than just understanding everything.</em></blockquote>

I wish someone could summarize it so nicely also when discussing about arts or free-economy.
